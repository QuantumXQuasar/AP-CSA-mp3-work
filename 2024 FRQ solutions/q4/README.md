# This problem was about:
* Basically we have this location class which really acts as a support for Grid, Grid contains the arraylist of numebrs in some 2D array.
* Our first objective is to create a getnextLoc() functions which will get our next location depending on the current location, the next location is either ot the right or down, whiichever is smaller value in that location, that is the one that is getting picked.
* Our second function, sumPath(), is basically the continuation or extension, of our first function, This function basically does getNextLoc() multiple times until it reaches the very end of the grid, in which it stops, it gets all the values it took from the path it tooks, and adds them together and returns that value.

# Struggles with this question:
* there weren't really any major difficulties, just had to figure out the logic behind this Skreky problem.

# Prior experiences that helped:
* knowing how to use manipulate 2D arrays would really helped
* knowing how to use row
* knowing how to use column
* indexes

# What I learned from this problem:
* Nothing really

* Me after realizing I forgot to include return sum; due to the pressure of time

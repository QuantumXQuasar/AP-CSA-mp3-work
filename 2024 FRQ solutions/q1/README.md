# This question was about:
* We have a feeder, 95% chance birds eat some or all of it. 5% chance Shrek eats all of it.
* All birds eat the same ammount grams of food. The specific ammount is determined randomly.
* All this question is about is bassically how much food is left in the feeder.

# Struggles with this question:
* the only, so called, challenging part int his program was figuring out how to set probability from 10 to 40, which was very specific and gave lot of students problems.

# Prior experiences that helped:
* Knowing how to use Math.random();
* This question was mainly about logic. If you knew how to operate classes and your logical thinking skills are Shrek-like, you should have been fine.

# What I learned from this problem:
* Math.random() can be manipulated for almost every range.

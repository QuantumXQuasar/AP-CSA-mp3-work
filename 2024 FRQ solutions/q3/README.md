# This question was about:
* This question revolved around ArrayList
* Basically we have a bunch of words in an arraylist and we have to create 2 functions.
* The first function, isWordChain(),  bascially has to return true or false depending on if the arraylist's each element contains the previous element as a substring.
* The second function, createList(), takes in some, user determined, String and if the String in the original list contains that user-made argument, then that element gets added to our new list, but first it snatches away the first accurance of the user-chosen argument and then puts it on the list. Ultimately, the function has to return the new list.

# Struggles with this question:
* No major difficulties, just required some thinking on how to work with 2 arraylists.

# Prior experiences that helped:
* Knowing how arraylists worked.
* .size(), .get(), etc. all helped
* Moreover, knowing String methods such as .substring() really helped.

# What I learned from the problem:
* Mike Shrezovski

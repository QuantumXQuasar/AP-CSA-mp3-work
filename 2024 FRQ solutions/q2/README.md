# This question was about: 
* This question requires you to write the whole class.
* We have two teams who play.
* We have a function recordPlay() which just gives the score to the whichever team's turn it is.
** the game starts off with the first tea, as long as that team doesnt get 0 score, they remain their turn, if they get a 0, they lose the turn. Of course, the summation of scores before the team loses the turn is recorded.
* We also have getScore() which returns the score of each team and whos turn it is.

# Strugles with this question:
* there weren't any particular struggles I had difficulties with. If you knew how classes worked, your response should have been as good as Shrek throws the donkey.

# Prior experiences that helped:
* knowing how classes worked
** declaration of instance variables
** creation of constructor
** creation of functions in the classes.

# What I learned from the problem:
* AP test gives you these random game rules to code that no sport ever uses.
